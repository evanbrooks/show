                        Agamatrix makes medical devices for people with
                        diabetes. As an intern, I developed a visual language
                        for their mobile interfaces.

                        The system can accomodate additional warning messages as the legal and medical teams identify them, so app development works more smoothly with the risk management team.

                        These projects were made possible by a team
                        of engineers, medical professionals, legal counsel,
                        and designers. We designed a system that could accomodate
                        new and changed language required by medical and legal
                        teams quickly, without adding extra warning screens for the person
                        using the app to fight through.

                        Maps, though, are our mental models for the

                        even on the map. This visualization makes buses first-class
                        citizens. That means time as important a dimension as space.
