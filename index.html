                        Agamatrix makes medical devices for people with
                        diabetes. As an intern, I developed a visual language
                        for their mobile interfaces.

                        The guide emphasizes clarity,

                        targets and type size.

                        The system can accomodate additional warning messages as the legal and medical teams identify them, so app development works more smoothly with the risk management team.

                These projects were made possible by a team
                of engineers, medical professionals, legal counsel,
                and designers. We designed a system that could accomodate
                new and changed language required by medical and legal
                teams, and those changes could be implemented by
                engineers 
            </p>
            <p>
                I completed these designs under the supervision of
                Tim Golnik and Joe Flaherty, in collaboration
                with Eric Gravlin.
